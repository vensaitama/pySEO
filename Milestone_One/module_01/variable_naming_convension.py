# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# firstname or first_name or _first_name (ok)
#  first_namr (not okay)
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive 
# (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)


first_name = 1
firstName = 2
first_Name = 3

# firstName = "Santa" -- Camel Case
# First_Name = "Santa" -- Snake Case (Most used in Python)
